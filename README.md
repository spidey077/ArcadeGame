# Laser Bounce Madness

**Laser Bounce Madness** is a fast-paced browser arcade game built entirely with **React**. The game uses the HTML5 **canvas** for rendering and runs directly in the browser. Players control a diamond-shaped character, avoid bouncing enemies, fire lasers, and collect power orbs while the game gradually becomes more challenging.
